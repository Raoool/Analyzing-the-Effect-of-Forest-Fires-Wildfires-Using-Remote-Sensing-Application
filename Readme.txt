This script read satellite images (Landsat 8 Image), process metadata, and calculate various Surface Reflectance and information from the data. 

Filepath Selection: The code starts by selecting a filepath based on the operating system (ispc for Windows and isunix for Unix-based systems).

Loop Over Dates and Bands: The code then enters a loop that goes over a range of dates (100 to 148) and a range of bands (1 to 7). Inside this loop, it checks if a specific directory exists and reads image data and metadata if it does.

Reading Image Data: The script reads georeferenced image data from specific bands (1 to 7) using geotiffread. It also reads metadata from a corresponding MTL file.

Calculating Surface Reflectance: The script calculates surface reflectance values using a given multiplicative factor RMUL and an additive factor RADD.

Creating Data Masks: It creates masks to filter out unwanted data points. It identifies and masks out certain types of pixels, such as fill values, clouds, cloud shadows, etc.

Calculating Location Masks: The code then seems to define a region of interest (ROI) using specific geographic coordinates and converts these coordinates to pixel coordinates using the georeferencing information. It creates a mask for this region.

Calculating Statistics: For each date and band, the script calculates the mean and standard deviation of surface reflectance values within the defined ROI, taking into account the cloud and mask conditions.

Calculating Remote Sensing Indices: NDVI and Burn severity index were calculated.

Saving Results: At the end of each iteration through the dates and bands, the script saves the calculated mean and standard deviation values, as well as related date information, into a MAT file named 'P43R33_CaldorFire2.mat'.

Loop Completion: The loop continues for all specified dates and bands, and after finishing all iterations, a message is displayed indicating the completion of the script.
